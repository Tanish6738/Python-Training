Python Docs on Python.org documentations.

difference btw the 32 and 64 bits

why the python come ?

what is variable .

Why hertz not meter per second ? 

memory in 2d is like and excel sheet.
    
    Address ,value and variable

    like linkedList.

We Store the data in the Cell and the reference in the variable


PEP 8 is the Python guide for the Style  =  https://pep8.org/


NameSpace - is a dictionary where the All the Data types are mapped in the Python

Operators Arithmetic , Logical , Assignmenet , Bitwise = (PIPE, AMPERCENT, TILDE , CRAT)


DATA TYPE - list , tuple , string , (Range - generator and iterators of list) . 

colon significe the scope of if ,else, elif ,while for anything is started

By default the syntax and format of string is single quote.

WE cannot perform the concatination in the sets 

we have the continous memory allocation so we can use the loop on the sequential things which is either 

    we can read it using the index and elements directly 

    why we use the commas in range because range() is a function.

    """s_str = "Hello"

    ans = "r"
    var = ans + s_str[1:] Deep Copy
    print(ans + s_str[1:])""" Shallow Copy

    difference btw the Shallow Copy and deep copy like  in the shallow copy the variable is terminated after the complete execution of the program but the in the deep copy the new values will be stored in the program after the program ends


    Range used as generator and iterators.
