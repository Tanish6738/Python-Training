# Write a Python program to create a function that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown given number.

# Sample Output:
# Double the number of 15 = 30
# Triple the number of 15 = 45
# Quadruple the number of 15 = 60

Double = lambda a : a * 2
triple = lambda a : a * 3
Quadarple = lambda a : a * 4
pentaple = lambda a : a * 5

print(Double(15))
print(triple(15))
print(Quadarple(15))
print(pentaple(15))
